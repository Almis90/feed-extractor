<title>News: Rakudo Perl 6 development release #29</title>
<link href="http://use.perl.org/article.pl?sid=10/05/23/1130246&amp;from=rss"/>
<summary type="xhtml"><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">colomon writes "On behalf of the Rakudo development team, I'm pleased to announce theMay 2010 development release of Rakudo Perl #29 "Erlangen". Rakudo is an implementation of Perl 6 on the Parrot Virtual Machine (see http://www.parrot.org./ The tarball for the May 2010 release is available from http://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/downloads . Rakudo Perl follows a monthly release cycle, with each release named after a Perl Mongers group. The May 2010 release is code named "Erlangen" in recognition of Erlangen.pm and the Perl 6 talk that Moritz Lenz, one of our core developers, gave this month. Some of the specific changes and improvements occurring with this release include: * Lexical classes and roles were implemented. Additionally, anonymous classes which were never quite right in alpha are now implemented more correctly, and anonymous roles are also supported. * Basic support for named enumerations of the form 'enum Weekday ' has been restored. * First cut of use Foo:from and eval('foo', :lang); needs Blizkost[1] to be installed to work. * Numeric / Real roles much closer to the spec now. * As always, many additional small features and bug fixes make working with Rakudo more pleasant. * Rakudo now passes 32,347 spectests. We estimate that there are about 39,500 tests in the test suite, so Rakudo passes about 82% of all tests. For a more detailed list of changes see "docs/ChangeLog". The development team thanks all of our contributors and sponsors for making Rakudo Perl possible, as well as those people who worked on parrot, the Perl 6 test suite and the specification. The following people contributed to this release: Solomon Foster, Moritz Lenz, Jonathan Worthington, Martin Berends, chromatic, Carl Masak, snarkyboojum, Stefan O'Rear, Reini Urban, Jonathan Scott Duff, takadonet, Christoph Otto, isBEKaml, ash_, bubaflub, Jimmy Zhuo, Peter Lobsinger and Patrick Abi Salloum If you would like to contribute, see http://rakudo.org/how-to-help , ask on the perl6-compiler@perl.org mailing list, or ask on IRC #perl6 on freenode. The next release of Rakudo (#30) is scheduled for June 17, 2010. A list of the other planned release dates and code names for 2010 is available in the "docs/release_guide.pod" file. In general, Rakudo development releases are scheduled to occur two days after each Parrot monthly release. Parrot releases the third Tuesday of each month. Have fun!

<summary type="xhtml"><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"> 'Please would you tell me,' said Alice, a little timidly, for she was not quite sure whether it was good manners for her to speak first, 'why your cat grins like that?' 'It's a Cheshire cat,' said the Duchess, 'and that's why. Pig!' She said the last word with such sudden violence that Alice quite jumped; but she saw in another moment that it was addressed to the baby, and not to her, so she took courage, and went on again:-- 'I didn't know that Cheshire cats always grinned; in fact, I didn't know that cats COULD grin.'

<title>Call for venue for YAPC::Europe 2011</title>
<link href="http://use.perl.org/article.pl?sid=10/04/12/1418217&amp;from=rss"/>
<summary type="html">BooK writes "While YAPC::Europe 2010 preparations are well underway in Pisa, it is time for the YAPC::Europe Foundation (YEF) to look for suitable sites for the 2011 conference. Any dedicated group interested in hosting YAPC::Europe::2011 should send a brief statement of intent to venue@yapceurope.org. This should be followed by a complete application. The deadline for applications is June 30, 2010. For details on how to prepare your complete application, consider the examples of previous conferences. If your proposal is selected, it will be added to the others on this page (you will have the opportunity to remove private information first). Be certain to include contact information (including telephone numbers) for at least two members of the group. You may also direct any questions to the aforementioned email address. A decision on the location will be publicly announced at the start of the Pisa conference. Looking forward to your submissions, &amp;nbsp;Philippe Bruhat (BooK) &amp;nbsp;on behalf of the YAPC::Europe Venue Committee"&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://use.perl.org/article.pl?sid=10/04/12/1418217&amp;amp;from=rss"&gt;Read more of this story&lt;/a&gt; at use Perl.&lt;/p&gt;</summary>
